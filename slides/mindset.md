# Mindset

<v-clicks>

- Code less, ship more
- Integrate, don’t reinvent
- Own less, maintain less
- Pick battle‑tested bricks
- Optimize for readability
- `stdlib` > zero dep-deps > other magic
- Delete ruthlessly

<!--
Fewer lines but more important fewer surprises, bugs. Python concept
Compose from small, tested parts, improve code without having to write more
Lower surface area, easier life
Stable, supported, fewer footguns overall
Clarity over cleverness, always everywhere
Zero deps first, add later
