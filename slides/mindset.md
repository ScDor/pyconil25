# Mindset

<v-clicks>

- Code less, ship more
- Integrate, don’t reinvent
- Own less, maintain less
- Pick battle‑tested bricks
- Optimize for readability
- `stdlib` > zero dep-deps > other magic
- Delete ruthlessly

<!--
Fewer lines, fewer surprises, bugs
Compose from small, tested parts
Lower surface area, easier life
Stable, supported, fewer footguns overall
Clarity over cleverness, always everywhere
Zero deps first, add later
